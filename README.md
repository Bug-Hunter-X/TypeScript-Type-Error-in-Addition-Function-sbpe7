# TypeScript Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a simple type error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to take two numbers as arguments and return their sum. However, in the example usage, a string is passed as the second argument. This leads to a type error during compilation because TypeScript's type system detects the type mismatch.

The solution shows how to fix the type error by ensuring that both arguments are numbers.
